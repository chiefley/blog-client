# Blog Network Design Summary

## Project Overview
This document summarizes the design decisions for a React-based blog network that uses WordPress as a headless CMS.

## Styling Framework.
- Uses the official Material UI React component library
- Styling is handled through Material UI's built-in styling system (which uses Emotion or styled-components under the hood)
- Does NOT use Tailwind CSS at all

## Design Decisions

### Layout Structure
- **Left sidebar** containing:
  - Search functionality
  - Hierarchical categories list with post counts
  - Tags cloud with post counts.
  - Admin links section
- **Single-column main content area**
- **Responsive design** that adjusts for mobile devices (sidebar collapses to a drawer)

### Post Preview Style
- **Horizontal card layout** with image on the left and content on the right
- Each card includes:
  - Featured image (1/3 width on desktop)
  - Category
  - Tags
  - Post title
  - Excerpt text
  - Author info with avatar
  - Comment count
- Single column of these previews rather than a grid layout

### Featured Content
- Large hero section at the top with overlay text for featured posts
- Full-width image with gradient overlay for text readability

### Individual Post View
- Shows featured image,
- Chips for Categories and Tags
- Post Title
- Maintains the same sidebar for consistent navigation
- Full content area with rich text formatting
- Author bio section at the bottom
- Comments section using WordPress Native Comments

## Featured Image
  - Uses information provided by Better REST Featured Image plugin.
  - Lazy loading of all images.

### Visual Style
- Clean, modern aesthetic using blue as the primary color
- White cards on light gray background for content
- Subtle shadows and rounded corners for depth
- Tag-based navigation with visual indicators

## API Access
- All api structures specified in an interface.ts files.
- All requests and responses go through a single wordpressApi.ts file.

### Mobile Considerations
- Sidebar collapses to a toggle-able drawer on mobile devices
- Post previews stack vertically (image above content) on small screens
- Responsive typography that adjusts size based on viewport
- Touch-friendly tap targets for navigation
